# Entry 3: Progress Report #1
##### Brianna Peralta on February 3rd, 2026 (02/03/26)

## Main Information: 

Wow. It hasn't even felt like a long time, but now I'm officially in the big 2026! This is your first look at now 17 Year Old Bri (I officially turned that on January 8th), so.. Woo! Anyways after setting a goal for myself right before WInter Break began, students were now expected to try and pursue it to the best of their capabilities. For a refresher of my goal, I wanted to try and use elements from [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) (specifically the `onKeyPress({})` command) as well as basic Javascript knowledge in order to randomly generate a question based on a specific topic. This was especially important to me since, depending on the outcome, I might end up implementing this on my final project when the time comes! Now that I think about it, me doing this now just further reflects the overall goal of using a tool for your freedom project, so I suppose good job me? Anyways, did I actually make something that could work as intended? Did I make my dreams come true?.. Short answer, yes. Long answer however.. That'll further be explained in the next session!
