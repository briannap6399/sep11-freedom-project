# Entry 3: Progress Report #1
##### Brianna Peralta on February 3rd, 2026 (02/03/26)

## Main Information:

Wow. It hasn't even felt like a long time, but now I'm officially in the big 2026! This is your first look at now 17 Year Old Bri (I officially turned that on January 8th), so.. Woo! Anyways after setting a goal for myself right before WInter Break began, students were now expected to try and pursue it to the best of their capabilities. For a refresher of my goal, I wanted to try and use elements from [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) (specifically the `onKeyPress({})` command) as well as basic Javascript knowledge in order to randomly generate a question based on a specific topic. This was especially important to me since, depending on the outcome, I might end up implementing this on my final project when the time comes! Now that I think about it, me doing this now just further reflects the overall goal of using a tool for your freedom project, so I suppose good job me? Anyways, did I actually make something that could work as intended? Did I make my dreams come true?.. Short answer, yes. Long answer however.. That'll further be explained in the next session!

## Tinkering Progress:

Before I dive into the exact code, I will say this: Simpler yet efficient is **always** better than elaborate yet convoluted. You might not entirely understand why I'm saying this now, but by the time I'm done demonstrating my progressions, it might be more easy to understand? I hope so anyways. Now, I had already mentioned `onKeyPress({})` and essentially it can become a function of it's own. By giving the command a specific key to look for, it will wait for that key to be pressed and once that happens, certain events could happen such as making a connected sprite move in a certain direction, changing your screen to another scene, or simply changing the apperance of your sprite: It all just depends on your inputs. For a great comparison, think about the `.addEventListener()` programmers can use in the DOM, and it's essentially that but initiated by Kaboom. Since it was my first time using it without any additional backing
