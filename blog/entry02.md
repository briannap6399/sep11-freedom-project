# Entry 2: Goal Setting
##### Brianna Peralta on December 15th, 2025 (12/15/25)

## Main Information:

In Blog 1, I established that I wanted to work on Kaboom, and I can recall the struggle to actually try and use [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/), but now that I don't need to worry about trying to set up Kaboom, I genuinely spent a lot of time trying to tinker and play with Kaboom has to offer. Since it's the ideal type of game for the tool is a platformer, it featured a good amount of commands and keys that suits a "2D Scale" such as `onKeyPress()` and `onKeyDown()`, which triggers an event to occur depending on what Keyboard key gets used. For example, take a look at this strand of Javascript:

```js
kaboom();

const moveSpeed = 500;
loadSprite("Placeholder", placeholder.png);

const spritePlaceHolder = add([
sprite("Placeholder),
area(),
body(),
])

onKeyDown("r", () => {

spritePlaceHolder.move(moveSpeed,0),
})
```

This might be a little hard to digest, so let's break it down into something more simple. The `kaboom();` command at top essentially connects Kaboom to your coding project, allowing you to use whatever it has to offer. The variable `moveSpeed` in this context is supposed to represent how fast something will move, with the speed now having a value of 500. `loadSprite()` is, as the name implies, the command that allows for a sprite to feasibly be generated and portrayed on one's game screen.
